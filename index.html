    <h1 class="title">Have you ever climbed a mountain, driven across a bridge, or attended a school whose name made you wonder:<br>Who is this named after and why?</h1>
<br></center>
<p class="main-text">
Names matter. Throughout history, women often couldn't keep or pass on their names. Immigrants were often forced to change their name and now create pseudonyms to assimilate to modern-day society. Enslaved people were not even allowed to know their anscestors' names.<br><br>
    
Names are deeply personal. Preferred names, nicknames, government names–these are important cultural signifiers.<br><br>

Do the namesakes in your community reflect its current demographics, values, and heroes? What kind of a message does it send when seemingly every school is named after a deceased white man–usually one who was rich, a politician, or both.<br><br>
        
    This website is about paying attention, disrupting the status quo, and making sure that our namesakes reflect our current reality.</p>
